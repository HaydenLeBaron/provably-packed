# Josh Bukoski's 3 Season Packing System

[Josh Bukoski's Site](https://www.joshbukoski.com/)


A NOTE: Josh Bukoski's system is a clothing-oriented system, not a conditions-oriented system. In other words, the he defines starts with a list of gear and specifies the ideal
properties for each piece of gear, instead of starting with a list of conditions and specifying the ideal gear for each condition. This example demonstrates an inverted
way of using provably packed.

## Clothing System

Notes From his [excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xKCqQSMjvE) about his ultralight 3 season clothing system.
I highly recommend you watch if you are into optimizing your gear for backpacking trips.
